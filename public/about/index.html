  <h1>About me</h1>

  <article id="content">
    <h4 id="planning-center---lead-developer">Planning Center - Lead Developer</h4>
<p>Most recently, I&rsquo;ve built several products for Planning Center. The base of operations is in San Diego, but there are a bunch of us spread all over the place (I’m in sunny Seattle, WA). A fantastic group of people.</p>
<h4 id="the-city---foundercto">The City - Founder/CTO</h4>
<p>Back in 2008, I founded and built a social network for churches called The City. It was acquired by Zondervan, a subsidiary of Harper Collins, a subsidiary of News Corporation. I think it had nearly a million users by the end there.</p>
<h4 id="amazoncom---infrastructure--software-sr-manager">Amazon.com - Infrastructure &amp; Software Sr. Manager</h4>
<p>I did some really neat stuff at Amazon.com: competitive pricing, sales anomaly detection…stuff we would describe today as data science-like things. I’m quite proud of the team and technology I built there (we made a ton of money for AMZN, Jeff liked us, the team is now 10x the size as when I left), the patents are descriptive of what we accomplished together:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anomaly Detection is <a href="/7574382.pdf">US Patent No 7,574,382</a></li>
<li>Competitive Pricing is <a href="/7740172.pdf">US Patent No 7,740,172</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="los-alamos-national-lab---student">Los Alamos National Lab - Student!</h4>
<p>Way back in the day while a student at Cornell, I worked as an intern on the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory. I wrote a simple C++ program to model something about the neutral current detectors. It’s been too long that I honestly don’t remember, but the team at LANL was awesome and I learned a great deal about science and a bit about software. Thanks Pete and Andy!</p>
<p>Oh, and the chief scientist behind SNO jointly won the Nobel Prize in Physics 2015. Congratulations!</p>
<h4 id="also">Also&hellip;</h4>
<p>In 2017, I released my first Science Fiction novel! You can find <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Singular-Zack-Hubert-ebook/dp/B06X3VGBVP/">Singular</a> on Amazon and at other places where fine books are sold.</p>
