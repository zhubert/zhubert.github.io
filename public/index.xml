      <description>Planning Center - Lead Developer Most recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve built several products for Planning Center. The base of operations is in San Diego, but there are a bunch of us spread all over the place (I’m in sunny Seattle, WA). A fantastic group of people.&#xA;The City - Founder/CTO Back in 2008, I founded and built a social network for churches called The City.
