    <h2><a href="/articles/the-power-of-incremental-work/">The Power of Incremental Work</a></h2>
    <p>Quite a while ago, I wrote a review of The New Turing Omnibus. A very clever book whose double entendre title reinforced the wit with which the subject matter was to be handled. In short, a very fun book that covers a lot of Computer Science topics.

    <h2><a href="/articles/an-amazon-story/">An Amazon Story</a></h2>
    <p>This last week I was sitting with friends around a campfire and told the following true story. They found it rather interesting, so I figured it was worth retelling.
