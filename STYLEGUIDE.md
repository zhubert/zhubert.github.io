# Zack Hubert Writing Style Guide

This guide documents the writing style and voice of Zack Hubert, based on analysis of his published novel *Singular* and blog posts. Use this as reference when assisting with writing tasks.

## Core Voice

**Consistent across all formats:** Conversational, technically fluent, story-driven, and warmly intelligent. Writes like talking to a smart friend over coffee.

## Narrative Approach

### Fiction (Singular)
- Third-person limited, multi-POV
- Short chapters with momentum-building cliffhangers
- High-concept sci-fi grounded in relatable human emotions
- Fast pacing through varied sentence length
- Mystery/puzzle elements woven throughout

### Non-fiction (Blog)
- First-person personal narrative
- Anecdote → Insight structure
- Self-aware meta-commentary ("but I'm getting ahead of myself")
- Teaching through storytelling

## Sentence Patterns

### Signature Rhythms
- Short. Punchy. Fragments for emphasis.
- Mix with longer, flowing sentences for variety
- Transitional openers: "But anyway," "Just then," "Well,"
- Standalone reactions: "Sigh." "Hot damn." "Whoops!"

**Example from blog:**
> "Oh, the oncall. Of course, I was single and working 80+ hour weeks, so what's a few more hours in the middle of the night, right? Needless to say, it wears on you after awhile."

## Dialogue & Character Voice
- Natural, no "As you know, Bob" exposition
- Technical characters use jargon organically
- Humor emerges through character interaction
- Minimal dialogue tags when rhythm is clear
- Distinct voices per character

## Technical Writing
- Explains without condescending
- Context over definition
- Assumes reader intelligence
- Specific when it matters ("B61 Mod 7 nuclear weapon, 340 kilotons")
- Accessible without dumbing down

## Humor Style
- Self-deprecating parenthetical asides
- Situational, never forced
- British-isms for flavor ("Maths")
- Character-based comedy
- Examples: "(e-commerce…what a funny name now)" / "(name lost to the mists of time…sorry!)"

## Emotional Beats
- Restrained but present
- Shows emotion through physical detail
- Earns big moments through buildup
- Never melodramatic
- Example: Milo's grief shown through action, not telling

## Stylistic Markers
- Parenthetical asides (frequent)
- Ellipses for trailing thought...
- Em dashes for interruption — like this
- Single-sentence paragraphs for punch
- "Just then" as transition device

## Vocabulary
- Clear, specific, unpretentious
- Technical terms in natural context
- Pop culture references (Princess Bride, etc.)
- Contractions throughout
- Active voice dominates

## Pacing Control
- White space = breathing room
- Paragraph length varies (1-6 sentences)
- Action = short sentences
- Reflection = longer flow
- Chapter/section breaks create rhythm

## Thematic Interests
- Technology ⟷ Humanity intersection
- Underestimation → Proving worth
- Mentor/found family relationships
- Incremental progress philosophy
- Problem-solving mindset

## Strengths
1. Makes complex technical concepts accessible
2. Balances action with emotional depth
3. Distinctive voice without calling attention to itself
4. Natural dialogue
5. Efficient description (no purple prose)

## Key Differentiators

The writing feels **conversational without being casual**, **intelligent without being pretentious**, and **technical without being dry**. A gift for making readers feel like insiders to complex ideas.
