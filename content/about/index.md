## Zack Hubert

I'm an engineering leader, founder, and occasional novelist.

Currently, I'm building products at **Planning Center** from Seattle.

### Some highlights

**Founded The City** (2008)
I built a social network for churches that grew to nearly a million users before being acquired by Zondervan/HarperCollins.

**Built data science systems at Amazon**
Before "data science" was a buzzword, I led teams building competitive pricing and anomaly detection systems. The work resulted in two patents and made Jeff Bezos quite happy.

**Contributed to Nobel Prize-winning physics**
While at Cornell, I wrote modeling software for the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory at Los Alamos National Lab. The project's chief scientist won the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics.

**Published a novel**
In 2017, I released [*Singular*](https://www.amazon.com/Singular-Zack-Hubert-ebook/dp/B06X3VGBVP/), a science fiction novel about AI and what it means to be human.

### Patents

This blog is where I write about building software, leading teams, and the power of doing small things consistently over time.
