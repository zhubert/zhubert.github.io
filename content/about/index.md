{{< work-card image="/planning-center.png" title="Planning Center (current)" position="right" >}}
Leading engineering teams at Planning Center. We build tools that help churches run better. Turns out that's a surprisingly complex problem.

Wrote a science fiction novel called [*Singular*](https://www.amazon.com/Singular-Zack-Hubert-ebook/dp/B06X3VGBVP/). Vintage computers, artificial intelligence gone rogue, the fate of humanity—you know, the usual first novel stuff.

**Founded The City (2008)**
Built a social network for churches from scratch. Grew it to nearly a million users before Zondervan acquired it. That was fun.

**Early data science at Amazon**
Built pricing algorithms and anomaly detection systems before "data science" was even a thing. Earned two patents. Made Jeff happy.

**Contributed to Nobel Prize-winning physics**
As an intern at Los Alamos National Lab, I wrote some modeling software for the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory. Very small role, but hey—the project's chief scientist won the [2015 Nobel Prize in Physics](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2015/summary/).

## Recent Projects

{{< work-card image="/rush-screenshot.png" title="Rush Programming Language" position="left" url="https://www.zhubert.com/rush" >}}
Built an [experimental programming language](https://www.zhubert.com/rush) from scratch using AI pair programming. Functional + OO paradigms, three-tiered execution (interpreter → bytecode VM → ARM64 JIT), and surprisingly fun to write.

{{< work-card image="/transformer-screenshot.png" title="Intro to Transformers" position="right" url="https://www.zhubert.com/intro-to-transformers" >}}
Writing an [interactive book](https://www.zhubert.com/intro-to-transformers) that teaches transformer architecture from first principles. Covers building transformers, understanding gradients, and generating images from noise—all through hands-on Jupyter notebooks.
